* YMWV (Your milage will vary)
- Kali changes often
- What works for me might not work for you
- Don't try everything at once - you'll run into bugs / usability issues and become unproductive
- To learn, I write tests / do them daily for 5-6 days
- Just because I don't like somethings UI/UX, doesn't mean I hate the contibutors or that it's wrong
- Yell your questions out!

* HCI and why it's important
- We're advanced computer users
- We're only going to be using our computers for the rest of our lives, get it right now!
- Tablet computers - WTF happened?
- Doherty Threshold

** Unix Philosohpy
'Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new "features."' - Doug McIlroy, E. N. Pinson, B. A. Tague (8 July 1978)

* Kali
- Uses Gnome3, GDM, Gnome Terminal, Nautilus
- GDM seems broken
- Kali-rolling releases are frequent, migration seems broken, need to reroll environment with each release.

* 
[[file:kali-rolling-screenshot.png]]

* Internode Kali Mirror
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.backup
MIRROR="http://mirror.internode.on.net/pub/kali/"
echo "deb $MIRROR kali-rolling main contrib non-free" \
  > /etc/apt/sources.list
apt update
#+END_SRC
- Please don't download large tools (eg KDE / Gnome / Mate / Xfce) while here!

* X11 / X.org (The good)
- X11 initally released in 1984
- Is a protocol that handles rendering data to a display as well as handling input devices
- XFree86 was common up until 2004 when it was superceded by the X.Org fork
- X11 supports VNC-like client/server behaviour, multi-seat setups (two screens/keyboards/mice) and other obscure stuff

** X11 / X.org (The bad)
- Most application toolkits these days do no longer draw X11 primitives, instead they draw bitmaps
  - Results in bad network speeds (compared to only sending X11 protocol commands)
- Some limitations around vsync exist within X11, resulting in video tearing. IIRC this is a result of core code and pretty much marked a wontfix. 

** Video Tearing
[[file:hackers_tearing.jpeg]]

** X11 / X.org (The ugly)
- Some graphics drivers that fix tearing, they work but are a 'hack'.
- Some stuff like hiding the mouse in-place seem to be difficult to achive without hacks
- X11 doco *was* limited last I checked

* X11 Functions
- By default runs on Virtual Terminal 7
- Render windows to display
- Pass keyboard / mouse events to the window manager, and 'active window' etc
- Ctrl + Alt + F1-F7 to swap between VTs, useful for debugging when X11 is broken
  - *Ctrl + Alt + F7 to go back to X11*
- Can run multiple instances of X11 on different VTs
- Handles Keyboard / Mouse I/O
* DPI
- Dots per inch
- 1 inch${}^2$ on a 23" Monitor @ 1080p = ~96ppi
- 1 inch${}^2$ on a 23" Monitor @ 2160p = ~191ppi
- DPI settings will increase surface / text size, while maintaining crisp look
- Setting not perfect
- YMMV on the following: 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
echo "Xft.dpi: 175" > ~/.Xresources
xrdb ~/.XResources
#+END_SRC

* DPI (Continued)
- 175 DPI 
[[file:dpi_175.png]]
-  96 DPI
[[file:dpi_96.png]]

* X11 Tools
- (Mostly) work universally despite WMs
- Normally prefixed by 'x'
- Modify resoultion: 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
xrandr
xrandr --output HDMI-2 --mode 1920x1080
xrandr --output HDMI-2 --leftof HDMI-1
xrandr --output HDMI-2 --off
#+END_SRC

- Key repeat rate:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Key delay, first arg is ms from keydown to keyrepeat 
# (lower = faster), second is mhz between key repeat (higher = faster)
xset r rate 220 75 
#+END_SRC
More later on!

* xset r rate demo
#+REVEAL_HTML: <video controls><source src="xset_rate.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>  

* Wayland
- New protocol removing a bunch of legacy code and simplifying the graphics stack
- Fixes tearing among other things, composite extensions at a much lower level
- X11 applications are not compatible with Wayland, need an intermediary library (XWayland)
- GUI toolkits need to be rewritten to support Wayland, not individual applications (unless they use X11 calls)

* Wayland (The bad)
- Are Wayland window managers are still scarce?
- Not a drop in replacement
- This talk focuses on X11, if you want to try Wayland, check out the latest editions of Fedora Core

* Window Managers
- Handle:
  - Initial placement of windows on the screen
  - Decorations
  - Window movement
  - Resizing / Maximize / Minimize / Always on top
  - Implement 'Workspaces'
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Alt + Tab, workspace switching, etc)
  - Startup Applications (sometimes)
** Tiling Window Managers 
- All windows are shown at 100%, no space is wasted!
- There is still more than one way for window placement to take place!
- Tiling window managers rock in theory, in some practical applications they fall over - sometimes can be fixed
- i3 tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4 

* My Current Config
- Openbox Window Manager
- Tint2 Taskbar
- Zsh
- Urxvt terminal + kitty
- Compton (composite manager, fade animations)

* My Current Config - Demo
#+REVEAL_HTML: <video controls><source src="longdemo-cut.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

** Window Managers (Continued)
- Some window managers / applciations *aren't compliant* with X11 spec, there's also some pretty dirty hacks throughout the stack. 
- Most pure window managers look terrible with stock configs.
- Some are scriptable, allowing you to hook into window events or do other cool things

* Desktop Environments
- Typically 'more' than just Window Managers but loosely defined
- Destkop environments usually handle the taskbar, application starters, computer settings, wallpapers etc
- Personally not a fan of GUI configuration tools
- Most DE components can be used seperately

*** Common Desktop Environments
Gnome3 (Kali Default), Mate (A gnome 2 fork), Cinnamon, KDE, XFCE, LXDE, Unity
*** Pure WMs
i3, Openbox, Ratpoison, QTile, awesome, bspwm, dwm, Ratpoison, qTile, xmonad, Sway (Wayland i3 clone)

* Dotfiles
- Common term for configuration files stored on github/notmicrosoft
- Public repo https://github.com/YoloClin/dotFiles
- My gitignore (simplified):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
*
!*/
!path/to/unignored
#+END_SRC

* Grapical Toolkits
- Most graphical applications use a GUI toolkit
- Toolkits provide a standardised method for developing GUI applications, so stuff like buttons, input fields, scroll bars etc all look and behave consistently
- Common toolkits include:
 - GTK2, GTK3 (Most common in Kali)
 - QT
 - Tk
 - SWING (Burp)

* Theming
- Consistency? You will need to theme + configure most/all of them!
- Icons are seperate to themes
- Firefox with dark themes breaks pages
 - override with a 'light' theme and provide a custom theme plugin (pretty easy)
- Chrome ignores everything
- Window manager decorations are different to themes
- Shell colour configurations (Check my .Xresources)

** Theming Resources
- Check out reddit.com/r/unixporn (SFW, AFAIK)

*** Key Driven Browsers
https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/5i23id/your_lightweight_keyboard_driven_browser_of_choice/

** Composite Extensions
- Transparency, windows transition effecs, 'wobbly windows', 'cube effect' etc. 
- Compiz was the most over-the-top composite window manager. Gnome3 -> Kali default
- Composite extensions don't *need* to be baked into the WM, at least in X11. 
- Require graphical acceleration
- Complex surfaces such as transparency and 'Cube' effects blow out compression on screenshots / VNC

*** My current composite manager
- Very basic, snappy fade from window to window

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
apt install compton
compton -f -D 3
#+END_SRC

** Testing Window Managers / Doing other obscure stuff
- Xephyr is basically an X11 session within a window
- Useful for testing window managers / themes
- Can also be used in a 'multiseat' environment and bind to a second keyboard and mouse
- Superseed XNest a few years ago. 

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Start Xephyr running on $DISPLAY 8
Xephyr  +extension RANDR -screen 800x600 :8 -ac &
# Run xterm inside Xephyr
DISPLAY=:8 xterm
# Alternatively, run a WM within Xephyr
DISPLAY=:8 openbox
#+END_SRC
* 
[[file:xephyr.png]]

* Login Managers
- GDM seems broken on Kali
 - is why shutdown seems to take 3-4 minutes
 - 'default WM' seems to revert
- Do we need a login screen?

** LXDM
Supports autologin, lightweight, Window manager be configured from homedir
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Set WM to gnome
echo "gnome-session" >> ~/.xprofile
# Will prompt to set default login manager, choose lxdm
apt install -y lxdm
# Configure relevant areas of lxdm config
sed -i "s/# autologin=dgod/autologin=root/" /etc/lxdm/lxdm.conf
sed -i "s/# skip_password=1/skip_password=1/" /etc/lxdm/lxdm.conf
#+END_SRC

** SLiM
LXDM doesn't seem to work well on Ubuntu, SLiM does very similar:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
apt install -y slim

echo "#!/bin/bash" >> ~/.xinitrc
echo "exec gnome-session" >> ~/.xinitrc
chmod +x ~/.xinitrc
#+END_SRC
Note: SLiM is pretty much inactive / dead, there's probably better alternatives.

* Lock Screens
- None of the lightweight lock tools are great, from my experience
 - i3lock has 'pop over' bugs when composite manager is active
  - devs either can't or won't fix it
  - also crashes when active window is a VirtualBox VM
- lightdm lock had some bizarro behaviour
- xscreensaver is ugly
- Silvio could probably crash them all
** My current lock screen
[[file:lock.png]]

* WMs / DEs
- Some Window Managers out of the box are ugly
- upto you to customise
- Screenshots: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_environment 
- Comparison: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_X_window_managers 

*** Floating
Gnome, KDE, Xfce, Openbox, Weston (Wayland only)
*** Tiled
i3, ratpoison, qtile, bspwm, xmonad, awesome

* A quick note on Terminal Emulators
- Seems like Gnome-Terminal (Kali default) doesn't play well with non-gnome environments
- Probably fixable, but didn't get time to troubleshoot
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
apt install -y xterm
# Set default to xterm
update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator
#+END_SRC


* Mate
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
apt install -y mate-core mate-desktop-environment-extra
echo "mate-session" > ~/.xprofile
#+END_SRC
file:MATE-1.14_7.png

* Xfce
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
apt install xfce4
echo 'xfce4-session' > .xprofile
/etc/init.d/xdm restart
#+END_SRC
[[file:xfce4.10-2.png]]

* i3
- Most popular tiled window manager
- Video tutorial a good starting point https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1I63wGcvU4
  - Note that font stuff in tutorial is a hack
[[file:i3.png]]

* Openbox
- Basic WM
- Ugly out of the box - use obconf to configure
- No taskbar by default, my preference is tint2 ( https://gitlab.com/o9000/tint2 )
- Doco: http://openbox.org/wiki/Configuration

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
apt install -y openbox tint2
exec openbox >> ~/.xprofile
# Configure
mkdir -p ~/.config/openbox
echo "#!/bin/bash" >> ~/.config/openbox/autostart
echo "compton -f -D 3 &" >> ~/.config/openbox/autostart
echo "tint2" >> ~/.config/openbox/autostart
chmod +x ~/.config/openbox/autostart
#+END_SRC

* Utilities
** rofi
- A simple 'run' dialog
- supports better autocomplete than 'dmenu'
- Highly customizable - https://youtu.be/ARKIwOlazKI?t=1678 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
apt install -y rofi
rofi -show run
#+END_SRC
** 
[[file:rofi1.png]]
*** 
file:rofi2.png

** 
file:rofi3.png

** GUI File Explorers
- I Mostly use BASH / ZSH, but:
 - pcmanfm
 - thunar
 - nautilus

** Image Viewers
- eog
- mirage
- feh
- gimp (editor)

** Video / Audio
- mplayer
- ffmpeg (encoding)
- mpd (music player daemon)
 - clients: gmpc, ncmpc, mpc, M.A.L.P (Android)
- kodi

** Ansible
- Define a state the system should be in
- Ansible ensures the system meets the desired state, handles package installs etc
- Really useful when managing multiple hosts / rebuildable bare metal environments
- Microsoft has equivalent w/ Powershell

** Script
- Records tty input *and* output, can replay it later
- Basic usage: 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
> script recording.shell; 
> echo "hello world"; 
> exit;
> cat recording.shell
#+END_SRC

- Put it in your zshrc?
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
if [ "$(ps -ocommand= -p $PPID | awk '{print $1}')" != 'script' ] ; then
    script -q -f \
     $HOME/.shell_logs/$(date +"%d-%b-%y_%H-%M-%S")_shell.log && exit
fi ;
#+END_SRC

** Misc
- Pushover.net - push notification web service
- pushover-notify - python wrapper + shell script to pushover
- healthchecks.io - 'dead-man switch' service
- supervisor - run python scripts as daemons
- gnu pass - standard unix password manager https://www.passwordstore.org/
- fdupes - quickly find duplicate files
- lxappearance - theme configuration toolkit
- Fonts - fontawesome, open-sans, source-pro
- redshift - reduce bluelight at night

** Screenshotting
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
apt install scrot
mkdir -p ~/screenshots
scrot '~/screenshots/%Y-%m-%d_%S_$wx$h.png'
# Screenshot currenly focused window, include border + decorations
scrot -u -b '~/screenshots/%Y-%m-%d_%S_$wx$h.png'
#+END_SRC

** X11 tools

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# send key events to window active 2 seconds into the future
sleep 2; xdotool type "echo 'Hello World!'"; xdotool key 'Return' 

xev      # Listen to key / mouse events, useful for keybinding
xrandr   # Mod resolution / enable / disable monitors on the fly
xkill    # send kill signals to window 
# protip: I also use pkill to kill a process by name
xprop    # Window info, useful when debugging tiled wms
xwininfo # More window details
wmctrl   # Manipulate windows (size, location, title etc) 
#+END_SRC

* Keybinds
- Hugely underrated, muscle memory vs point and click
- RSI is real
- Keybinds are per-window-manager
- My config (don't be me):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
Alt + A: Terminal
Alt + F2: rofi (Pretty universal for some form of run dialogue)
Alt + Ctrl + Left / Right: navigate workspaces
F11: Fullscreen some apps
#+END_SRC
- Have remapped copy/paste in terminal to Ctrl + C / Ctrl + V, has side effects

* Keybinds (Continued)
- I should probably make use the 'windows' key
- What about volume up / down, resize windows etc?
- Can use xmodmap to modify the keylayout, replace Capslock with Ctrl or some other mod
- If you use a touchpad daily, or your mouse sensitivity isn't configured please do that!
- Is qwerty / dvorak really optimal? Backspace is probably my most used key...

** Ergodox Ez
[[file:ergodox_ez.jpg]]

* Terminal Emulators
- Colour (16 vs 256 vs 32bit colour)
- Resize mode (Don't use xfce4-terimnal)
- Scrollback
- Edit Mode (Key driven select/copy of historical code)
- Unicode / emojis
- Pseudo transperancy / backgrounds
- Previously used urxvt, doesn't play well with zsh + Powerline 9k. Now using Kitty, seems buggy but very powerful
- urxvt config: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kjbj-Ez1vU

** Bash
- Learn it! You'll use it forever, even if you run ZSH / Fish
 - https://www.tldp.org/guides.html
  - Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide
  - Bash Guide for Beginners
 - Man pages
- To configure shell edit =~/.bashrc= 
 - Technically runs on every shell, but exits on non-interactive (aka scripts) very early

*** My bashrc (the cool bits)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Strip out temp files from emacs / python etc. 
# ls -a will still show them
alias ls='ls --hide="#*" --hide="*~" --hide="*.pyc" --hide="__pycache__" --color=auto'

# command 'c' will change directory *and* list files
# technically cd is a BASH builtin so we need to define a function
c() {
    builtin cd "$@" && ls;
}
# 'p' will execute ipython interactive shell if it exists.
# Running with args will execute non-interactive
p(){
    if [ "$#" -eq 0 ] ; then
	/usr/bin/ipython || /usr/bin/python;
    else
	/usr/bin/python "$@"
    fi;
}

# Execute .pythonrc on interative start, contains imports of file io etc
export PYTHONSTARTUP="$HOME/.pythonrc"
#+END_SRC

*** My .bashrc (the cool bits) (Continued)
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# WARNING: The following stuff breaks interactive shell utilities such as 
# nano and emacs as they rebind Ctrl + C etc
# TTY-level rebindings. Ctrl-C is moved to Ctrl-G etc.
# Find them with stty -a.
stty intr ^G    # Formerly C-z, Stop current action (Formerly C-z)
stty erase ^Z   # Formerly C-?, Despite its name, seems to be undo
stty kill ^U    # Formerly C-u, The left hand version of C-k
stty werase ^W  # Formerly C-w, The left hand version of C-k

stty discard undef  # previously ^O, Seems to be return
stty start undef    # previously ^Q
stty stop undef     # previously ^S, Applies scrolllock in a tty
#+END_SRC

** Z Shell / Oh My ZSH
- ZSH is BASH on steroids, very similar basics but some nuances when scripting
- oh-my-zsh is a bunch of custom ZSH plugins, some are awesome, others can be very slow
- Recommend reading documentation for zsh and oh-my-zsh before using
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
apt install -y zsh git
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
#+END_SRC
- Another good alternative is fish shell - https://fishshell.com/

** ZSH Autocompletions
- There are loads on github
- useful for complex tools like VBoxManage, docker, ifconfig etc

* SSH 
*** Authorised Keys
- Key-based authentication
- Adding your key to a remote systems authorized_keys also adds autocompletion
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# View public key (Safe to send other people / post publicly)
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
# Add our own ssh key to our authorized_keys file
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Now we can ssh to our own system without a password
ssh localhost
#+END_SRC

*** SCP
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
scp root@remote:/path/to/remote/file path_to_save/file.txt
scp -r root@remote:/path/to/remote/ path_to_save/
#+END_SRC

*** SSHFS
- Allows mounting a remote systems fs over ssh
- Much slower than local file I/O
- NFS / SAMBA are better long-term solutions
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
apt install -y sshfs
mkdir /tmp/test/
mkdir /tmp/newmount/
sshfs root@localhost:/tmp/test /tmp/newmount
echo "hello" >> /tmp/newmount/hello.txt
umount /mnt/newmount
ls /tmp/newmount
ls /tmp/test
#+END_SRC

** X11 forwarding
- Useful, but slow
- Security impacts if one side is untrusted
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# These two require X11Forwarding is set to Yes in sshd_config
# Some operating systems have this disabled by default for security
ssh -Y root@localhost # Enables trusted X11 forwarding
ssh -X root@localhost # Enables X11 forwarding
# Can also render GUI remote system
ssh root@localhost "DISPLAY=:0 xeyes"
#+END_SRC

*** Job control
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
nohup xcalc &  # run xcalc, ignore hangup signal
xcalc & disown # behaves the same as nohup
# Alternatively...
Ctrl + z  # suspends the current job (freezes processing)
bg        # sends the current job to background (resume processing)
fg        # brings job back to foreground (unfreezes)
disown    # removes job from job list
$command 2>&1 # redirect stderr to stdout
#+END_SRC
** SSH Demo
#+REVEAL_HTML: <video controls><source src="ssh.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

*** Tmux
- Runs as a daemon, allowing sessions to stay alive after hangup
- Adds 'tab-like' behaviour to the terminal
- Can 'split' the terminal to two sub-screens
- Multiple clients connect to the same tmux daemon (multiplayer terminal!)
- Another alternate is GNU Screen, tmux is more popular
*** Demo
#+REVEAL_HTML: <video controls><source src="tmux.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

* Editors
- Pick one that's not nano
- Get good at it, watch tutorials
- VIM, Emacs, Atom, Sublime, Visual Studio Code etc

** VI / VIM 
- Probably the most popular editor
- Super fast navigation
- Online 'game' trainers that teach movement, https://vim-adventures.com/

** Emacs
- More featureful than VIM (*too* featureful?)
- Ergonomic hell, emacs pinky
- Ugly and basic out of the box, needs configuration
- Mike Zamansky's 'Using Emacs' series - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49kBWM3RQQ8&list=PL9KxKa8NpFxIcNQa9js7dQQIHc81b0-Xg
- Spacemacs - VIM-like interface to emacs - spacemacs.org
- If you learn emacs, learn org-mode.
